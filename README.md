# Tree Decompositions
We investigate the effect of different tree decompositions on 
graph grammars. 

## StarLog
- 19Mar17: Need to make sure the conversion to binarized tree works okay

- 08Mar16: plot/show the progression from the BoardExample file to 
  the binarized version and test other graphs


# Experiments

[Main Workflow (Rstudio)](ctrlRtdecomp.Rmd)
`python write_inddgo_graph.py -g ~/Theory/DataSets/out.brunson_southern-women_southern-women`
